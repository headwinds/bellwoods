# Cabin Quest
In the spirit of the Sierra Quest games, I wanted to make a game with a storyline and tactics but using modern web tech and open source code. More than a game, I think I'm most interested in building and contributing to the best open source game frameworks so that other aspiring game designers can contribute and make their owns based on a common structure; similar to how Lucas and Sierra built own [SCUUM](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Sierra) systems.

## Support
Some day it will be released as a game on Itch or Steam. You could clone it and sell it too. You could...but why would you?! You would get inspired by this repo and possibly use it as a base to create your own work of art.
